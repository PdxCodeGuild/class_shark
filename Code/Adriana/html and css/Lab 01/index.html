            <p>James Harris Simons (born April 25, 1938) is an American mathematician, billionaire hedge fund manager, and philanthropist. He is known as a quantitative investor and in 1982 founded Renaissance Technologies, a private hedge fund based in Setauket-East Setauket, New York. Although Simons retired from the fund in 2009, he remains its non-executive chairman and adviser.
            He is also known for his studies on pattern recognition. He developed (with Shiing-Shen Chern) the Chernâ€“Simons form, and contributed to the development of string theory by providing a theoretical framework to combine geometry and topology with quantum field theory. From 1968 to 1978, Simons was a mathematics professor and subsequent chair of the mathematics department at Stony Brook University.</p
            <br/>As reported by Forbes, his net worth as of February 2019 is estimated to be $21.5 billion.
            In 2016, asteroid 6618 Jim Simons, discovered by Clyde Tombaugh in 1936, was named after Simons by the International Astronomical Union in honor of his contributions to mathematics and philanthropy.<br />
