# Lab 14: Pick 6
# Have the computer play pick6 many times and determine net balance
# Inititally the program will pick 6 random numbers as the 'winner'. Then try playing pick6 100,000 times, with the ticket cost and payoff below.
# A ticket contains 6 numbers, 1 to 99, and the number of matches between the ticket and the winning number determines the payoff. Order matters, if the winning numbers are [5,10] and your ticket numbers are [10, 5] you have 0 matches. If the winning numberes are [5,10,2] and your ticket numbers are [10,5,2], you have 1 match. Calculate your net winnings (the sum of all expenses and earnings).
# - a ticket costs $2
# - if 1 number matches, you win $4
# - if 2 numbers match, you win $7
# - if 3 numbers match, you win $100
# - if 4 numbers match, you win $50,000
# - if 5 numbers match, you win $1,000,000
# - if 6 numbers match, you win $25,000,000
