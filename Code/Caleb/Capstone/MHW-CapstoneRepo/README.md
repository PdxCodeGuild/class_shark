# Milwaukie Hardwoods
## Capstone Project - PDX Code Guild Full-Stack Web Developer Bootcamp

*What are the major features of your web application? What problem is it attempting to solve?*

**Milwaukie Hardwoods is the internet home of the physical business, owned and operated by myself and my father. We are a resource to transport, mill, kiln-dry, and process local hardwood logs & lumber.**

Our primary issue is a fundamental marketing issue. We need to solicit free salvage logs from homeowners, arborists, and builders. We need to solicit log transport, milling, kiln-drying, and lumber processing work directly to customers. We need to exemplify that we are masters of our craft and demonstrate knowledge & provide value on the website in our content. We could also sell our lumber directly on the website.

*What libraries or frameworks will you use?*

**Front End:**
Since I have already experimented with Materialize.CSS earlier in the course, I am going Bootstrap for the bulk of my initial CSS framework. I would like to use some fancy buttons and other front-end libraries, including Vue.js.

There will be some quality photos on the site, even a gallery. If I have time I will hopefully include a video loop on the homepage.

**Back End:**

The back end of the project is going to be run on Django, which is a python-based back-end framework.

## User Stories:
- *“As the business owner, I would like to be able to update current species of wood in stock with photos and basic descriptions of each load coming out of the kiln”*

- *“As a customer, I would like to be able to learn more about the specific species offered by MHW”*

-  *“As a furniture maker, cabinet shop, or other wholesale customer, I want to send a request in for a large order of lumber and initiate an order request”*

- *“As a homeowner, arborist, or builder – I would like to be able be able to contact you via the website and film out a form to request a log pick-up without ever having to text or call you”*

- *“As a customer, I would like to pay an invoice online”*

- *“As a customer, business owner, and member of the greater MHW community of past and potential future customers, I would like to be able to post an entry on a “Community Projects” page, of a project made with MHW lumber, with a brief description and link if any to my project portfolio website, FB, or Instagram page.”*

- *“As a customer, I would like to order a piece of custom furniture to be made from an uncut log provided by myself or MHW – where I can track that tree’s history & life story, as well as a portal to an online platform which I can see updates from MHW about the processing of that tree from log, to milled lumber, to air-drying lumber, to kiln-drying lumber, to processing the lumber, and final furniture design & assembly. I could also approve designs for the proposed furniture, so all correspondence could be digital and easily followed on a single platform.”*
