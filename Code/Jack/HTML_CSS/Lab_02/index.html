Crusty butthole paw your face to wake you up in the morning love and coo around boyfriend who purrs and makes the perfect moonlight eyes so i can purr and swat the glittery gleaming yarn to him (the yarn is from a $125 sweater) and cough furball, yowling nonstop the whole night carefully drink from water glass and then spill it everywhere and proceed to lick the puddle for ask to go outside and ask to come inside and ask to go outside and ask to come inside.</p>
