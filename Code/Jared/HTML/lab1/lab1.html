		<h1>Vladimir Nabokov</h1>
		<h3>(1899-1977)</h3>
		<h3>The Early Years</h3>
			<p>
				Vladimir Nabokov was born to an aristocratic family in St. Petersburg. He spend his early years betwen living in their house in the city, and their estate Vyra, a setting in which many of his stories would reflect. As a boy Vladiimir wrote poetry, which he'd read with much encouragement to his mother. The Nabokov's lives would change forever, as they would flee Russia in 1917 during the Revolution, eventually landing in Berlin, Germany.

		<h3>Life as a Novelist</h3>
			<p>
		 		During his time in Berlin, Vladimir began writing short stories and his earliest novels, all written in Russian. But his time in Europe would again force the Nabokov's to pack up and leave. Vladimir had married a Russian-Jew named, Vera, and the unease that crept into Germany with Hitler's rise to power, caused Vladimir to uproot his family. They would leave Berlin for Paris, then Paris for the United States.

				Vladimir Nabokov's journey to America would start another chapter in his life, and his art. All his remaining works would be written in English. The English novel, which would bring him fame, and enable him to quit his teaching post at Cornell University, was Lolita. Among other notable titles from his American years are: "Pale Fire," "Ada, or Ador," and "Speak, Memory: An Autobiography Revisited." With the success of Lolita, the Nabokov's would move to Switzerland, where he would reside until his death 1977.
