# bullfrog
Blog is short for Bullfrog: A Django/Vue blog app 

Made as an example for [PDX Code Guild](https://pdxcodeguild.com/)'s Full Stack Python Course

This project initially follows the [Django Girls tutorial](https://tutorial.djangogirls.org/en/django_installation/), but eventually it scraps the Django templating system in favor of a REST API + Vue frontend.
