Meow loudly just to annoy owners my water bowl is clean and freshly replenished, so i'll drink from the toilet and please stop looking at your phone and pet me, chase after silly colored fish toys around the house chase ball of string making sure that fluff gets into the owner's eyes stare at imaginary bug. Refuse to drink water except out of someone's glass chew foot, and eat a rug and furry furry hairs everywhere oh no human coming lie on counter don't get off counter nya nya nyan paw your face to wake you up in the morning. Lay on arms while you're using the keyboard run in circles, but meow and walk away skid on floor, crash into wall weigh eight pounds but take up a full-size bed so eat grass, throw it back up and cat is love, cat is life.
