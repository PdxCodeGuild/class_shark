# Presentation Tips

On the final class date, you will give a presentation for your capstone project.

These presentations help you practice communicating technical topics in English. Being able to speak intelligently about programming is almost as important as programming itself. This skill will allow you to better talk to interviewers, managers, clients, coworkers, and more.

## Guide
1. In your presentations, you should first explain your application at a high level: what is your problem domain and what solution does your application present? Make it interesting. This is your first shot at capturing your audience's attention.

2. Then, demo your application. Show its features and interact with its UI. Give us a walkthrough of how a regular user might interact with your app.

3. Finally, explain the development process and the interesting parts of your code. How did you approach your solution? Highlight particularly unique or difficult portions of your code.

## Questions
Here are some questions to contemplate while planning out your presentation:
- What problem your application solve? What is the core function it performs?
- How did you go about planning?
- What major issues did you encounter during the course of development? How did you go about overcoming them?
- How did your vision for the project change over time?
- What part did you like the most? Least?
- What is the future of the project? What features (if any) will you work on next?
